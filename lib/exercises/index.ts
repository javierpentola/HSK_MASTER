// Update the exercises/index.ts file to export a function to get all exercise IDs
// This assumes the current file already exports getExerciseById and other functions

import { getAllExercises } from "./exercises" // Import the getAllExercises function

export function getAllExerciseIds() {
  // This function should return an array of all possible exercise IDs
  // You'll need to implement this based on your data structure
  // For example, if you have a list of exercises, you might do:

  // Get all exercises and extract their IDs
  const allExercises = getAllExercises() // Assuming this function exists
  return allExercises.map((exercise) => exercise.id)

  // If getAllExercises doesn't exist, you'll need to implement it
  // or use another approach to gather all exercise IDs
}

// Keep all existing exports
